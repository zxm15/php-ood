1. use cases
a. user write message to another user or a group of users
b. user could receive message 
c. voice message or video chat? not at this time. (The nature is the same, but data and bandwidth could be challenging)
d. add friend, remove friend.

2. system constraints
how many daily active users? 1M

average 100 messages 
1 message contains 200 characters

total data = 1M * 100 * 200byte = 20GB/day


3. design component, API, algorithm
start with the simple one, forget about the 1M users now.
components:
user service(friend)	message service				group chat service	
						mid, uid, uid, content		gid, uid, content timestamp
